              <h3>What We Need From Justin</h3>
              <hr/>
              <p>
                Justin Trudeau has been a dreamboat on a lot of issues, from gay rights to taxing the rich to respecting immigrants. But he‚Äôs breaking our hearts when it comes to climate and his passion for building dirty Tar Sands pipelines. Help us broadcast this hilarious and sexy video valentine on televisions in Ottawa where Justin lives. Together with Justin, we can stop the Kinder Morgan pipeline and save our climate.
              </p>
              <h4>‚úäüèæ Respect Indigenous Sovereignty</h4>
              <p>
                Seven First Nations in the pipeline's path (and dozens more all over the continent) have been fighting to stop Kinder Morgan for years. Justin <em>explicitly</em> promised that indigenous groups would have veto power over oil projects affecting their land and water. Now he‚Äôs steamrolling right over them. This is unacceptable.
              </p>
              <h4>üíß Water Is Life</h4>
              <p>
                If the Kinder Morgan pipeline becomes operational, it will cross scores of rivers and streams and imperil the fresh water of millions of Canadians. The dirty crude, known as bitumen, is toxic to the region's salmon. It will also mean 700% more oil tankers traversing the fragile waters of the Salish Sea (aka Puget Sound).
              </p>
              <h4>üí£ Real Hunks Don't Detonate Carbon Bombs</h4>
              <p>
                Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion would dramatically ramp up Big Oil's exploitation of the Tar Sands, one of the Earth's largest and dirtiest carbon deposits. "If Canada proceeds, and we do nothing, it will be game over for the climate," according to James Hansen, former head of NASA's Goddard Institute.
